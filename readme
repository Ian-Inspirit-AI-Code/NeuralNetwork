This is a simple neural network NEAT-based algorithm. This algorithm is heavily influenced by real-life evolution.

Node class encapsulates a weight and bias. It also has a list of all connected nodes.

Neural network class creates a rectangular dense grid of nodes. It is able to be given an output and run it through
all the nodes.

Population is where a large amount of neural networks (individuals) are created.

The NEAT algorithm would create a population. It would then find the best individual in the population (highest fitness),
and create offspring from that best.

I learned about NEAT algorithm through a youtuber: CodeBullet https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeBullet.
